# Jet Fighter

A reimagining of the 2 player 1975 Atari game.
A chat mini-app is available.
Two-player mode not implemented.

## Running

Run the batch file 'Jet Fighter.bat' (runs two instances on the same machine).
You need to have serial ports COM1 and COM2 set up, otherwise the application behaves unexpectedly.

## How to play
WASD for Jet 1, arrow keys for Jet 2.
C for Jet 1 to fire, M for Jet 2 to fire.
Hit Powerups collect them.
