# CMPN201-JetFighter

Microprocessor Systems Project - second year CUFE students.

A reimagining of the 2 player 1975 Atari game using Assembly.  
A chat mini-app is available.  
Two-player mode not implemented.  

## Running

Run the batch file 'Jet Fighter.bat' (runs two instances on the same machine).  
You need to have serial ports COM1 and COM2 set up, otherwise the application behaves unexpectedly.  

## How to play
WASD for Jet 1, arrow keys for Jet 2.  
C for Jet 1 to fire, M for Jet 2 to fire.  
Hit Powerups collect them.

TODO: Set option to use to working one-instance play mode
